# Midterm Report

## ITMT 430 2019 - Hugo Zamarripa

### Sprint 1 Ui/UX

1. Hugo: "Established team communications and dynamics on how we work best. Personal, established scope of the project, as well as initial drafts/skeleton of website UI."

* I was in charge of creating initial drafts of the UI/UX flowcharts and rough designs on what we wanted the page to look like, I reference old material from 361 and 362 to get a rough idea the best way to start.

Below is my initial assumption on how the flow of the website would go. correlating with part of the basic functions out report started on, getting a base.

### Sprint 2 Lead Developer

 1. Hugo: I worked with Tom to develop a search with tags, we solved this by doing a lot of deep reasearch into the cloudinary API documents to find we needed to match the metadata ID for each image and match it with the id of the metadata from the cloudinary image. We hope to do better next sprint in terms of communication and more early research. More steady commits between each other. We hope to able to do multiple search by tags. for example searching for photos with tags Cats & Dogs

 * I worked closely with Tom on the research on what to do for the project in terms of language of choice and integration with API, although I was Lead Developer I took a back seat focusing on research to how the API worked and helping Tom with his development in that way.we accomplished gettting the API to integrate with our Mongo.Db and get tags to work which aligned with our goals.

### Sprint 3 Project Manager

1. In this sprint I worked closely with my team to overhaul the API out of the system after being told 8 weeks in that it was not allowed. We also fell behind on other core aspects including
having a working development environment deployable via script, security, UI, and better reporting

Sample commits of report formating:
b0ab295b0f27b741b7dd1fd27df1010e3dbaa332

98590373f21566938db1d9114103881f8242dd48

I spent majority of my time communicating on the trello board assiigning tasks with more
alerts and due dates for my team as well as trying to ask more frequently about tasks.
we successfully overhauled the entire project away from the API but still fell short on other tasks,
we played catch up but it was part of our goals
